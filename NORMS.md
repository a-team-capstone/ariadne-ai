### Establishing Norms

Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

- What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?

  - Each explain view, then vote, if necessary bring in an outsider as a tie-breaker

- What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
  - Talk about it one-on-one if it’s a one-person issue
  - Bring it up early, don’t let it fester
  - Talk about it clearly & directly - don’t just hint at it
  - Let the group know if you’re just feeling self-frustrating/stressed
  - Taking a break is great if you want to do that before talking to the group
  - If necessary bring in a fellow
  - Encourage each other to take a break
  - Ask for pair programming, outside help if necessary

* What does this group do when we merge our work together?
  - PULL PARTIES - post in slack and talk in person
  - Resolve merge conflicts together
  - Merge at the end of the day before we leave
  - Aim for at least twice a day

- When does this group ask for help? After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?

  - After everyone has tried to solve it or at least help
  - First ask team mates for help, then help desk
  - Be very specific asking for help

- How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other? Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?
  - The two people decide amongst themselves
  - Always ok to say you need a break from pair programming

* How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)? Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?
  - Workout after hours is fine, as long as we communicate either in person right before we leave, or on Slack, about what we’re working on
  - Assigning ourselves to issues
  - No expectation to meet up after hours

- What time does this group have daily stand up?
  Between 10:30 and 11
